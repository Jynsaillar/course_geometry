# Course Geometry

Small tool for solving geometry course tasks.

## TL;DR:
* Install [**Miniconda** for **Windows 64-bit** with **Python 3.7.X**](https://conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
* Clone repository: `git clone https://github.com/Jynsaillar/course_geometry.git`
* cd into repository: `cd course_geometry`
* Create conda venv: `C:\Users\MyUser\Anaconda3\Scripts\conda env create -f environment.yml`
* Activate conda venv: `C:\Users\MyUser\Anaconda3\Scripts\conda env activate course_geometry`
* Run program using `main.py` as entry point: `python main.py`

## Disclaimer:

This program is very simple, as in it does not even have command line argument parsing. 
All changes are done directly in the code at the moment, this will be changed later when the need for it arrives.
